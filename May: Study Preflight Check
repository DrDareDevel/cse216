What data will you gather, and how will you analyze it? 

Data to gather: user settings for different house environment: dinner winter, dinner summer, peak hours summer, peak hours winter.

3-5 things that you'll measure: Energy Consumption, Money savings, CO2 savings, User Confort(?)

For each, how will you measure it, and what comparison will you perform with it?

As already mentioned in the Final Abstract, we are going to have two situation, the control Group and the Treatment Group. People
with the Control Group will set the house settings based on each scenario. We will calculate the Energy consumption accordingly.
People in Treatment Group will set the house settings by considering also our Energy-Meter that will show an instant feedback of 
Energy Consumption, Money Consumed and CO2 produced. 
We will compare the Energy consumption produced in the two Groups and see if the people that have instant feedback will be ablke to sacrifice 
a bit of confort for money saving and CO2 emission reduction. We will ask the Treatment group if the settings they use are still satysfying their
confort and how much.
